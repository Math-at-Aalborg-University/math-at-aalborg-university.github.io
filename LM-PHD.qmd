## Course Description

### Motivation

Time series analysis looks to capture the intrinsic information contained in the data by the use of statistical models. The typical model used in time series is the autoregressive moving average, $ARMA$, given by 
$$x_t = \alpha_0+\alpha_1x_{t-1}+\cdots+\alpha_px_{t-p}+\varepsilon_t+\theta_1\varepsilon_{t-1}+\cdots+\theta_q\varepsilon_{t-q},$$ 
where $\{\varepsilon_t\}$ is a random disturbance.

Long Memory deals with the notion that certain series have autocorrelation functions, a measure of the impact of past observations, that decay slower than what any $ARMA$ model can account for. The autocorrelation function for a long memory process shows hyperbolic decay instead of the typical geometric decay for $ARMA$ models. This translates into perturbations having significant effects even after much time has passed. Its presence has repercussions for inference and prediction. 

Long memory has been detected in several time series, including inflation, volatility measures, electricity prices, and temperature. As an example, @fig-acf-temp presents the monthly temperature deviations series of the Northern Hemisphere and its autocorrelation function. The series presents long memory in the sense that its autocorrelation function is still significant after 100 periods. Any disturbance in temperature takes a long time to disappear, which is relevant for studies like the ones associated with Climate Change.

The course will provide an introduction to long memory in time series, including estimation, testing, and applications. The course will provide participants with the necessary knowledge to understand and analyse long memory in time series. 


### Outline

This course will provide an introduction to long memory in time series. The course will cover the following topics:

- Introduction to long memory and motivation
- Estimation of long memory models
- Forecasting with long memory models
- Applications of long memory models
