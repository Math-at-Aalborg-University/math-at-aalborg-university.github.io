## Course Description

### Motivation

Time series analysis looks to capture the intrinsic information contained in the data by the use of statistical models. The typical model used in time series is the autoregressive moving average, $ARMA$, given by 
$$x_t = \alpha_0+\alpha_1x_{t-1}+\cdots+\alpha_px_{t-p}+\varepsilon_t+\theta_1\varepsilon_{t-1}+\cdots+\theta_q\varepsilon_{t-q},$$ 
where $\{\varepsilon_t\}$ is a random disturbance.

Long Memory deals with the notion that certain series have autocorrelation functions, a measure of the impact of past observations, that decay slower than what any $ARMA$ model can account for. The autocorrelation function for a long memory process shows hyperbolic decay instead of the typical geometric decay for $ARMA$ models. This translates into perturbations having significant effects even after much time has passed. Its presence has repercussions for inference and prediction. 

Long memory has been detected in several time series, including inflation, volatility measures, electricity prices, and temperature. As an example, @fig-acf-temp presents the monthly temperature deviations series of the Northern Hemisphere and its autocorrelation function. The series presents long memory in the sense that its autocorrelation function is still significant after 100 periods. Any disturbance in temperature takes a long time to disappear, which is relevant for studies like the ones associated with Climate Change.

This course introduces to models for time series with such strong persistence and tools for the statistical analysis thereof. The leading  model is fractional integration of order $d$, $I(d)$. We discuss the properties of sample moments and conditions for limiting normality. Next, the estimation of the memory parameter $d$ is addressed.

Then we turn to efficient tests for values of $d$. Further, we will study regression analysis under fractional cointegration amongst several time series. Moreover, a competing model to fractional integration called harmonic weighting is introduced.  If time allows, we may briefly touch upon further topics such as long memory in volatility, cyclical long memory or forecasting.


### Background and Reading

1. Our starting point is the  short-memory $I(0)$ process covered in classical books by \citet{BrockwellDavis91}, \citet{Fuller96} or \citet{Hamilton94}. Relevant background material will be covered in quick review chapters in the beginning of this course.
	
2. From $I(0)$ we enter the range of stationary long memory, $0 < d < 1/2$, continue with (different degrees of) nonstationarity and move towards unit roots, $I(1)$.
	
3. Long memory has received a lot of attention in time series analysis over the last decades. For instance, the updated edition by @box2015time contains a section on long memory and fractional integration, and so does @palma2016time; earlier textbooks like @brockwell1991time [Sect. 13.2], and @fuller1996introduction [Sect. 2.11] include short sections on this topic, too.
	
4. Much of the material treated in this course is covered in the books by @beran2013long, @giraitis2012large, or @hassler2019time. We will walk through an extensive set of slides with many details.
	
5. The structure of this course, most of the material and the notation from the slides are taken from @hassler2019time.
