The series is aimed to provide a platform to present and discuss research in a more casual setting.\nThe seminars are held on a Friday from 12:15 to 13:00 at the latest but usually end earlier. For the fall 2024 semester, they will be held in Fib16 1.201. The event is open to everyone, you only need to bring your lunch and enjoy the presentations.\nThe LSS is organized by Eduardo Vera-Vald√©s.

    "text": "Time series analysis looks to capture the intrinsic information contained in the data by the use of statistical models. The typical model used in time series is the autoregressive moving average, \\(ARMA\\), given by \\[x_t = \\alpha_0+\\alpha_1x_{t-1}+\\cdots+\\alpha_px_{t-p}+\\varepsilon_t+\\theta_1\\varepsilon_{t-1}+\\cdots+\\theta_q\\varepsilon_{t-q},\\] where \\(\\{\\varepsilon_t\\}\\) is a random disturbance.\nLong Memory deals with the notion that certain series have autocorrelation functions, a measure of the impact of past observations, that decay slower than what any \\(ARMA\\) model can account for. The autocorrelation function for a long memory process shows hyperbolic decay instead of the typical geometric decay for \\(ARMA\\) models. This translates into perturbations having significant effects even after much time has passed. Its presence has repercussions for inference and prediction.\nLong memory has been detected in several time series, including inflation, volatility measures, electricity prices, and temperature. As an example, Figure¬†1 presents the monthly temperature deviations series of the Northern Hemisphere and its autocorrelation function.
