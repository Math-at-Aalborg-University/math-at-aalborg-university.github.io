The Lunch Seminar Series (LSS) is a monthly event hosted by the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Aalborg University. The series is aimed to provide a platform for researchers, students, and industry professionals to present and discuss their work in an informal setting.

The seminars are held on the last Friday of each month from 12:00 to 13:00. The event is open to everyone, you only need to bring your lunch and enjoy the presentations.

The LSS is organized by [J. Eduardo Vera-Vald√©s](https://everval.github.io/). If you are interested in presenting your work, please use [this email](mailto:eduardo@math.aau.dk).
