title: "Lunch Seminar Series"

The Lunch Seminar Series (LSS) is a monthly event hosted by the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Aalborg University. The series is aimed to provide a platform to present and discuss research in a more casual setting. 

The seminars are held on a Friday from 12:15 to 13:00 at the latest but usually end earlier. The event is open to everyone, you only need to bring your lunch and enjoy the presentations.

The LSS is organized by [Eduardo Vera-Valdés](https://everval.github.io/). If you are interested in presenting your work, please use [this email](mailto:eduardo@math.aau.dk). Currently, we are accepting volunteers for the fall 2025 semester.
