## Course Description

### Motivation

Resampling techniques are a powerful tool in the hands of statisticians and data scientists. They provide a way to estimate the distribution of a statistic without making strong assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. This is particularly useful when the data is not normally distributed or when the sample size is small. Resampling techniques are widely used in a variety of applications, including hypothesis testing, confidence interval estimation, and model selection.


### Contents

Day 1: Resampling under independence

- Jackknife, bootstrap and subsampling approaches
- Bias, variance, and distribution estimation
- Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests
- Accuracy of bootstrap
- Linear models and heterogeneity
- Nonparametric density and regression estimation

Day 2: Resampling under dependence

- Block bootstrap
- Model-based bootstrap
- Sieve bootstrap
- Periodogram bootstrap (brief exposition)
- Subsampling
- Non-stationarity and  long memory
