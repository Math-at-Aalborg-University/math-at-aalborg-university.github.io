    "title": "Long Memory in Time Series PhD Course",
    "section": "Course Description",
    "text": "Course Description\n\nMotivation\nTime series analysis looks to capture the intrinsic information contained in the data by the use of statistical models. The typical model used in time series is the autoregressive moving average, \\(ARMA\\), given by \\[x_t = \\alpha_0+\\alpha_1x_{t-1}+\\cdots+\\alpha_px_{t-p}+\\varepsilon_t+\\theta_1\\varepsilon_{t-1}+\\cdots+\\theta_q\\varepsilon_{t-q},\\] where \\(\\{\\varepsilon_t\\}\\) is a random disturbance.\nLong Memory deals with the notion that certain series have autocorrelation functions, a measure of the impact of past observations, that decay slower than what any \\(ARMA\\) model can account for. The autocorrelation function for a long memory process shows hyperbolic decay instead of the typical geometric decay for \\(ARMA\\) models. This translates into perturbations having significant effects even after much time has passed. Its presence has repercussions for inference and prediction.\nLong memory has been detected in several time series, including inflation, volatility measures, electricity prices, and temperature. As an example, Figure 1 presents the monthly temperature deviations series of the Northern Hemisphere and its autocorrelation function. The series presents long memory in the sense that its autocorrelation function is still significant after 100 periods. Any disturbance in temperature takes a long time to disappear, which is relevant for studies like the ones associated with Climate Change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Temperature for Northern Hemisphere and its autocorrelation function.\n\n\n\nThis course introduces to models for time series with such strong persistence and tools for the statistical analysis thereof. The leading model is fractional integration of order \\(d\\), \\(I(d)\\). We discuss the properties of sample moments and conditions for limiting normality. Next, the estimation of the memory parameter \\(d\\) is addressed.\nThen we turn to efficient tests for values of \\(d\\). Further, we will study regression analysis under fractional cointegration amongst several time series. Moreover, a competing model to fractional integration called harmonic weighting is introduced. If time allows, we may briefly touch upon further topics such as long memory in volatility, cyclical long memory or forecasting.\n\n\nBackground and Reading\n\nOur starting point is the short-memory \\(I(0)\\) process covered in classical books by , or . Relevant background material will be covered in quick review chapters in the beginning of this course.\nFrom \\(I(0)\\) we enter the range of stationary long memory, \\(0 &lt; d &lt; 1/2\\), continue with (different degrees of) nonstationarity and move towards unit roots, \\(I(1)\\).\nLong memory has received a lot of attention in time series analysis over the last decades. For instance, the updated edition by Box et al. (2015) contains a section on long memory and fractional integration, and so does Palma (2016); earlier textbooks like Brockwell and Davis (1991, Sect. 13.2), and Fuller (1996, Sect. 2.11) include short sections on this topic, too.\nMuch of the material treated in this course is covered in the books by Beran et al. (2013), Giraitis, Koul, and Surgailis (2012), or Hassler (2019). We will walk through an extensive set of slides with many details.\nThe structure of this course, most of the material and the notation from the slides are taken from Hassler (2019).\n\n\n\nContents\n\nEmpirical Examples\nReview: Stationary Processes\nReview: Moving Averages\nFrequency Domain\nDifferencing and Integration\nFractionally Integrated Processes, \\(I(d)\\)\nSample Mean\nEstimation of \\(d\\) and Inference\nHarmonically Weighted Processes\nTesting\nFractional Cointegration\nFurther Topics\n\n\n\nInstructor\nProf. Dr. Uwe Hassler from Goethe University Frankfurt.\n\n\nReading Material\n\n\nBeran, J., Y.

    "text": "Course Description\n\nMotivation\nResampling techniques are a powerful tool in the hands of statisticians and data scientists. They provide a way to estimate the distribution of a statistic without making strong assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. This is particularly useful when the data is not normally distributed or when the sample size is small. Resampling techniques are widely used in a variety of applications, including hypothesis testing, confidence interval estimation, and model selection.\n\n\nContents\nDay 1: Resampling under independence\n\nJackknife, bootstrap and subsampling approaches\nBias, variance, and distribution estimation\nConfidence intervals and hypothesis tests\nAccuracy of bootstrap\nLinear models and heterogeneity\nNonparametric density and regression estimation\n\nDay 2: Resampling under dependence\n\nBlock bootstrap\nModel-based bootstrap\nSieve bootstrap\nPeriodogram bootstrap (brief exposition)\nSubsampling\nNon-stationarity and long memory\n\n\n\nInstructors\n\nProf. Z. Psaradakis, Birkbeck, University of London.\nMarian Vavra, National Bank of Slovakia\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nBasic knowledge of time series and statistics.\n\n\nECTS Credits\nThe course offers 2 ECTS credit points, subject to approval from your supervisor.
